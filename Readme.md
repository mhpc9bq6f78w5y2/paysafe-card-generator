# Paysafe Card Generator 🛡️

This Python script simulates a Paysafe card generator that generates random card numbers and checks their validity. It then prints the generated card numbers along with their validity status (simulated) to the console. If a card is found to be valid, it is added to a list of valid cards. Finally, the valid cards are saved to a text file.

## How it Works

1. **Card Generation**: Random 16-digit card numbers are generated using the `generate_card` method.

2. **Validity Check**: Each generated card number undergoes a validity check using the `check_validity` method. This method simulates the process of validating a card number's checksum.

3. **Printing Results**: The script prints each generated card number along with its validity status to the console.

4. **Saving Valid Cards**: If a card is found to be valid, it is added to a list of valid cards. After all cards are processed, the valid cards are saved to a text file.

## Usage

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Navigate to the directory containing the script.

cd main

3. **Run the Script**: Run the Python script.

python main.py

4. **View Output**: The script will generate and check Paysafe card numbers, printing the results to the console.

5. **Valid Cards File**: After execution, a text file named `valid_paysafe_cards.txt` will be created containing the valid Paysafe card numbers.
